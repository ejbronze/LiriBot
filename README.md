<p>
This project is LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

The app support the following commands:

concert-this
movie-this
spotify-this-song
do-what-it-says

Input can be one or more strings without need to enclose in quotes.
